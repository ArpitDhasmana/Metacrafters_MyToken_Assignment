In this we have to create a contract that is able to mine and burn tokens and for this
First of all we create three variables to store the details of the token.
Then we create a mint function to create new tokens and also increase the total supply of the tokens
Then we create a burn function to burn existing tokens of an address given that no_of_tokens_address>=no_of_tokens_to_be_burned
This explains the logic and intention of our code
