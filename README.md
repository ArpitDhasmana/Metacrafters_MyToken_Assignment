# Project Title

Creating and Destroying Tokens.

## Description

This project is to demonstrate the simple use of solidity , a programming language genrally used in web3 development(Used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain). The contract has two simple fucntion , a mint function to create new tokens and a burn function to destroy the existing tokens , it is a simple project based on solidity which will help us to climb up the ladder in the learning game of Blockchain development.

## Getting Started

### Installing
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., Mytoken.sol). Copy and paste the provided code in the github repository.

### Executing program
To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "HelloWorld" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the sayHello function. Click on the "HelloWorld" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "sayHello" function. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the "Hello World!" message.
